<!-- TODO Determine a non-hacky way to get reasonable spacing here.
          Problem is there's no margin collapse for a flexbox.
          Tried to remove margin on children with nested selector,
          but no nested selector appeared to have any effect.
          Settled for manually-determined negative margins on the root Box.
          Set negative margin to same as <p>, effectively collapsing those. -->
